Free plan provides 10 GB of data per month (if you confirm your email address), and the Pro plan has unlimited data and access to servers in over 110 cities in 63 countries.\n\nStill not convinced? Perhaps this elegant list of features will convince you otherwise.\n\nStop tracking and browse privately\nGovernments block content based on your location. Corporations track and sell your personal data. Add Windscribe to your browser and take back control of your privacy.\n\nAdvanced Privacy Features\nWindscribe is not just a proxy extension. It's a suite of privacy tools which include:\n\nAd + Tracker Blocking - Ads and trackers follow you around, waste your bandwidth and compromise your privacy. Windscribe will block all this crap.\nMalware Blocking - Some sites distribute malware. We'll prevent you from ever ending up on those sites.\nSocial Blocking - Social networks are the biggest privacy invaders out there. Block their trackers.\nWhitelisting - Our block lists are not one size fits all. Customize your experience.\nLocation API Spoofing - Sites can request your GPS location why bypasses most proxies and VPNs. Not with Windscribe.\nWebRTC Blocking - Prevents WebRTC leaks that plague most proxy extensions and VPNs.\nTimezone Spoofing - Sites can detect that your IP doesn't match your browser's time zone. This feature solves this problem.\nNotification Blocking - Tired for sites asking you to send notifications? We are too. Enable this feature to never see those things again.\nUser Agent Spoofing - Helps combat browser fingerprinting\nCookie Monitoring - Leave nothing behind. This feature deletes 1st or 3rd party cookies when you close the tab.\nLanguage Spoofing - This feature will spoof your browser's language settings to match the proxy location of your choice.\n\nUnlock geo-restricted content\nWindscribe VPN masks your IP address. This gives you unrestricted and private access to entertainment, news sites, and blocked content in over 63 different countries.\n\nNo identifying logs\nYour privacy is a right. We don’t track you. We don't sell your data to marketers, or even share it with anyone. We don’t keep logs that can deanonymize you.\n\nGo beyond basic VPN protection\nFor comprehensive privacy protection even outside of the browser, use our desktop VPN applications (they’re also free). Available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Did we mention mobile? Yeah, there's mobile apps too.\n\n--------------\n\nHaving issues with Windscribe VPN or want to suggest something?

Give it a try!\nLet me know if you want other functions added.\n\nNote: During initialization the extension will create a 'SelectionSK' bookmark folder under 'Other Bookmarks' and populate it with search and translation URLs. Please modify this folder according to your needs, there are plenty of pre-configured URLs on the support site. Occasionally, on first installation, extension may receive doubled notifications from browser and show doubled items. In that case please restart a browser.\n\nFunctions:\n\n    Copy selected text to the clipboard in various ways (standard copy, copy as plain text, copy as html). In addition, the selected text can be copied to clipboard automatically.\n    Send selected text to pre-configured bookmarks. There are default search\\translate\\dictionary bookmarks (StartPage, Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, Wolfram|Alpha, Wikipedia, Google Maps, Google Images), in addition you can create your own. A lot of pre-configured bookmarks are available on the support site. It is extremely power tool and you can fully adopt it to your own needs - use it for everything from image search to currency convertor.\n    Alternatively, send selected text to installed search engines (Firefox 63 or newer only). Enable this option in the preferences.\n    Right mouse button click opens bookmark with quoted selected text aka 'phrase search'\n    Middle mouse button click opens bookmark and highlight all occurrences of selected text.\n    Translate selected text using Google Translate, Wordnik Thesaurus, Urban Dictionary, Yandex Dictionary or Microsoft Translator. Translation can be copied to the clipboard. Text-to-speech is available for both, original text and translation. In addition, translation window has a link onto page where full definition of translated text (for instance, pronunciation or usage examples) can be obtained.\n    Open the text as a URL. Text will be validating for the URL in a smart way – in addition to well-formed URLs, the extension will check broken URLs (for instance, without http prefix) and href attribute. Obfuscated URLs and email addresses like \"hxxp://website(dot)name(dot)com\" or \"mail(at)provider(dot)com\" will be detected and de-obfuscated.\n    Open or copy to clipboard multiple URLs at the same time instead of having to do them all individually.\n    Highlight all occurrences of the selected text. More than one word or phrase can be highlighted with different color. Move forward\\backward in between highlighted phrases using 'W' and 'S'. Remove highlighting by pressing 'Esc'.\n    Select currency with its symbol or abbreviation and convert it into desired currency.\n    Panel mode: a small panel with icons only will appear instead of a popup menu.\n    Unobtrusive mode: small, unobtrusive button will appear instead of popup menu. Popup menu will be activated if user clicks on the button or if user holds mouse cursor on the button for a second.\n    Context menu: send selected text to pre-configured bookmarks using traditional context menu.\n    Send the selection to the mail recipient. A new email window will be opened using mailto: protocol, selected text will be added as email body. In addition, selection will be copied to the clipboard, which allows to insert it to the email from the clipboard (useful if selection has images or rich html).\n    Toolbar icon provides a shortcuts to enable\\disable extension on certain site (left mouse click) or to preferences and page translation (right mouse click). Whole page can be also translated by pressing Ctrl+Shift+0.\n    Translate on demand, type 't <your word or phrase>' in the address bar.\n    Search on demand, add keyword to the bookmark and type '<keyword> <your word or phrase>' in the address bar.\n\n\nThe extension is also available for Chrome.\n\n\nSelectionSK will send selected text to online translators in order to get it translated. Please read their privacy policies.\n\nThank you for being interested in SelectionSK.

If you actively use bookmarks, this extension messes your bookmark search.\nThe extension does not work in a private window, but a private session can be saved from a regular (non-private) window.\nI repeat: this is not a replacement for the \"Session Manager\" from Michael Kraft.

From the co-founder of Google Inbox.","fullDescription":"SUPERCHARGE GMAIL WITH SIMPLIFY\nBrought to you by the co-founder and design lead for Google Inbox, Simplify Gmail is a browser extension for desktop Gmail that boosts productivity, strengthens privacy, and reduces️ stress by:\n\n✔️ Making hundreds of improvements (small and large) to streamline, simplify, and enhance Gmail’s design and functionality. No part of Gmail is left untouched. Messages are easier to scan, read, and compose. Once you install, compare Gmail before and after using Alt+S (⌥S on Mac).\n✔️ Blocking over 250 email spy trackers (more than any other tracker blocker extension).\n✔️ Adding intuitive keyboard shortcuts. Navigate faster with your arrow keys, Enter (to open, then to reply), and Escape (close a message, then to return to inbox). Use familiar shortcuts like Ctrl+A / ⌘A to select all or Ctrl+Z / ⌘Z to undo. Press \"?\" in Gmail to see all shortcuts.\n✔️ Adding a full dark mode with options to invert compose and all or only text messages.\n✔️ Letting you focus by turning off your inbox and optionally disable notifications. This isn't for everyone, but some appreciate being able to press pause and focus on their starred messages, drafts, etc without being distracted by new mail. Video demo\n✔️ Adding back the missing categories. Google Inbox had three other categories (Finances, Purchases, and Travel) that still work but Gmail doesn't link to. Simplify adds links to these in the nav with the other Categories.\n✔️ Providing over 40 options with great defaults so you can fine tune Simplify just the way you like. Options include changing the interface font, hiding unread counts, making the interface even more minimal, and more.\n✔️ And more, with more on the way There are tons of other details and features with more on the way.\n\n_________________________________________________________\nPAID PLAN REQUIRED AFTER 14 DAY TRIAL\n\nComes with a free 14-day trial after which a paid plan is required.

LanguageTool detects many errors that a simple spell checker cannot, such as grammar issues, commonly confused words, and punctuation oversights. Additionally, LanguageTool offers style suggestions to elevate your writing: synonym replacements for overused words, concise rephrasing of wordy sentences, and formal alternatives to commonly used expressions.\n\nLanguageTool is designed with simplicity in mind, instantly analyzing your text as you type. It is compatible with most platforms, including social networks such as Twitter and LinkedIn, and e-mail services such as Gmail.\n\nWith LanguageTool, our aim is to give users a full-feature grammar checker and proofreader that will enable them to have control and confidence over their content. While LanguageTool is a vital extension for non-native speakers, it also recognizes many mistakes that are frequently made by native speakers. This grammar and spelling correction works across several varieties of commonly spoken languages, and is capable of distinguishing between American and British English. LanguageTool also features a personal dictionary for exceptions or words that you might commonly use, but are not found in a conventional dictionary; it will learn to recognize these words for future grammar checking and proofreading.\n\nUnlike other services like Grammarly (a.k.a. Grammerly :-), ProWritingAid, and Ginger, LanguageTool supports more than 25 languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Polish, and Russian (see below for the complete list).\n\nYour privacy is important to us: By default, this extension will check your text by sending it to languagetool.org over a securely encrypted connection.

Requires Firefox 62+.","fullDescription":"Context Search\n\nFirefox add-on to search selected text in a web page using your favorite search engines.\n\nPermissions\n\nNotifications, Downloads, History and Bookmarks are now optional permissions. They are disabled by default. If you'd like to show notifications and/or save your list of search engines to your local disk, or search your history or bookmarks from the Omnibox, then open the extensions manager, select Context Search and under the Permissions tab enable the appropriate permissions.\n\nTo open search results in a new private window, in the extensions manager, allow Context Search to \"Run in Private Windows\".\n\nHow does it work\n\n    Select some text on a webpage\n    Right click (or Alt-click) on a selection\n    A context menu (or a grid of icons) appears, displaying the list of search engines chosen in the extension's preferences\n    Click on the search engine with which you’d like to search for the selected text\n\n\nThe search results will appear as defined in the extension's preferences page.\n\nManaging search engines\n\nTo manage your favorite search engines, you can go to the preferences page of Context Search. You can reach this page by opening the extensions page (Addon Manager) where all your add-ons are listed and then clicking on the \"Preferences\" button.\n\nPlease refer to the 4th screenshot above.\n\n    The checkbox at the start of a line determines whether the search engine should appear in the context menu.\n    The next item on the line contains the name of the search engine and is followed by a keyword.\n    This keyword is used in the url address bar (or omnibox) after the word “cs “ and before the search terms (e.g. to search for linux using the search engine Wikipedia, you would type: ‘cs w linux’, where w is the keyword assigned to Wikipedia).\n    Next, you can assign a keyboard shortcut to a search engine to perform a quick search. Please note that not all key combinations will work as some may be reserved by the browser or your system.\n    The second checkbox specifies whether you’d like to use the search engine in a “multi-search”. A “multi-search” is a search performed using multiple search engines and can be selected in the context menu of in the grid of icons.\n    The checkbox is followed by the search query string. This is the generic url you would use to perform a search. Search query strings may contain the parameters %s or {searchTerms} where you'd like your search terms, i.e. the selected text, to appear.\n    Click on and drag the move icon to the left of the trash icon to move each search engine up or down in the list.\n    Click on the trash icon to remove a search engine from the list.\n\n\nThe 'Reset' button will re-load the default list of search engines and their associated favicons.\n\nYou can also import a JSON file containing your own list of search engines. It is strongly recommended to export your customized list of search engines as a backup in case anything goes wrong.\n\nHow to add a search engine to your custom list\n\n* visit mycroftproject.com and click on the Context Search icon that appears before the textual link of a listed search engine\n* use the page action (i.e. Context Search icon in the url address bar) to add a search engine if the website supports open search\n* add a search engine manually via the Options page (you can test the query string before adding the search engine)\n\nHow to perform a search in the omnibox\n\nIn the omnibox (or url address bar), type 'cs ' (without the quotes, and where cs stands for Context Search) followed by the keyword you have chosen for your seaarch engine in the extension's preferences, e.g. 'w ' (again without quotes) for Wikipedia, followed by your search term(s). The dot ('.'), the exclamation mark ('!'), '!h' or 'history' and '!b' or 'bookmarks' are reserved keywords.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\ncs w atom\nwill search for the word 'atom' in Wikipedia.\n\ncs .\nwill open the Options page\n\ncs ! cold fusion\nwill perform a multi-search for the search terms 'cold fusion'\n\ncs !h or cs history\nwill display all your history\n\ncs !b Mozilla or cs bookmarks Mozilla\nwill display all bookmarks that include the term Mozilla\n\ncs !b recent or cs bookmarks recent\nwill display your 10 most recent bookmarks\n\nAdvanced features\n\nYou can add a regular expression to each search engine. If the selected text matches the regex, then the search engine will appear in the context menu. As an example, imagine you had a search engine for booking.com and another for tripadvisor.com and you would like these search engines to appear in the context menu when a selection contains the word 'hotel'. Then, for those search engines, you'd enter the regex /hotel/. If you then make any other selection that doesn't contain the word \"hotel\" in it, those search engines won't appear in the context menu. There's a very useful website for building a regex: https://regex101.com. Another example is, if you select an IP address, then you might want the search engine corresponding to whatismyipaddress.com to appear. The regex here is a little more complicated to establish, but Google can help: search Google for \"regex for ip address\".\n\nThe main structure of a JSON file containing the search engines\n\n```javascript\n{\n\"id\": {\n\"index\": 0,\n\"name\": \"search engine's name\",\n\"keyword\": \"keyword to be used in an omnibox search\",\n\"multitab\": \"takes the value true or false depending on whether this search engine should be included in a multi-search or not\",\n\"url\": \"search engine query string (without the search terms)\",\n\"show\": \"takes the value true if the search engine is to be shown in the context menu or false if not\",\n\"base64\": \"a base 64 string representation of the search engine's favicon\"\n}\n}\n```\n\nHere is an example of a JSON file containing 3 search engines:\n\n```javascript\n{\n\"bing\": {\n\"index\": 0,\n\"name\": \"Bing\",\n\"keyword\": \"b\",\n\"multitab\": false,\n\"url\": \"https://www.bing.com/search?q=\",\n\"show\": true,\n\"base64\": \"\"\n},\n\"google\": {\n\"index\": 1,\n\"name\": \"Google\",\n\"keyword\": \"g\",\n\"multitab\": false,\n\"url\": \"https://www.google.com/search?q=\",\n\"show\": true,\n\"base64\": \"\"\n},\n\"yahoo\": {\n\"index\": 2,\n\"name\": \"Yahoo!\",\n\"keyword\": \"y\",\n\"multitab\": false,\n\"url\": \"https://search.yahoo.com/search?p=\",\n\"show\": true,\n\"base64\": \"\"\n}\n}\n```\n\nIt is not required to provide the base 64 string representation of any search engine's favicon. This string will automatically be loaded for you.\n\nSpecial thanks to the following contributors\n\n    Carl Scheller for implementing the drag & drop feature to move search engines in the Options page\n    Geoffrey De Belie for the Dutch translation\n    Krzysztof Galazka for the Polish translation\n    Sergio Tombesi for the Italian and Spanish translations\n    Fushan Wen for the Chinese translation\n    Sveinn í Felli for the Icelandic translation\n\n\nCode made by others used in this extension\n\n    SortableJS v1.14.0 minified with many contributors, which can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable/blob/1.14.0/Sortable.min.js","weeklyDownloads":61,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Olivier de Broqueville","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/3516977/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/265/265047.png?modified=1643567097","width":2243,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/265/265047.jpg?modified=1643567097","thumbnailWidth":498,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/265/265038.png?modified=1643567097","width":1002,"height":782,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/265/265038.jpg?modified=1643567097","thumbnailWidth":513,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/265/265039.png?modified=1643567097","width":2243,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/265/265039.jpg?modified=1643567097","thumbnailWidth":498,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/265/265037.png?modified=1643567097","width":2178,"height":824,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/265/265037.jpg?modified=1643567097","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":202},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/217/217147.png?modified=1643567097","width":1781,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/217/217147.jpg?modified=1643567097","thumbnailWidth":396,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/odebroqueville?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.3917,"reviewCount":152,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/contextual-search/reviews/","updateDate":1643646077000},{"id":"winman@lionelw","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2637/2637712-32.png?modified=7cc277a2","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2637/2637712-64.png?modified=7cc277a2","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2637/2637712-128.png?modified=7cc277a2"},"name":"Winger - A Window Manager","version":"1.4.2","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3728147/winger-1.4.2.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":"https://github.com/l10nelw/winger/issues","description":"Name windows. Switch windows. Move tabs between windows. Stash windows away.","fullDescription":"With Winger, having lots of windows becomes a truly viable way to organize lots of tabs. Fluidly operate multiple windows with ease, and divide-and-conquer your tabs by topic, task, project, you name it – literally.\n\nHighlights\n\n    Once named, finding a window on the pop-up panel takes one glance; moving tabs between windows takes one click.\n    Spoils you with two ways to move tabs: \"send\" or \"bring\" to another window.\n    With Winger's omnibox, all actions can be done even quicker by typing a few keys. Great for power users.\n    Dear power users: Thanks to the omnibox, there are no keyboard shortcuts to remember (apart from the one that opens the panel) - you use more memorable slash commands instead.\n    Private window support: Tabs normally cannot be moved between private and normal windows, but Winger can automatically reopen them in windows you send or bring them to.\n    If enabled in settings, Winger makes it possible to move pinned tabs.\n    Stash windows you want to save and close, and easily restore them later. (This new feature is a work in progress, building up from basic functionality first. Significant improvements to come! Get in touch with me via email/github if you have feedback.)\n\n\nMore comprehensive information can be found in the Quick Guide accessed from the Help button.\n\nIs this like tab groups? Why manage windows?\n\nTab grouping is a popular tab management approach that has seen many implementations. Winger belongs in the same space but without the wheel-reinvention: instead of introducing a made-up tab collection context, you just use windows, the efficient and original \"tab groups\" that also delivers all the familiar features provided by your browser and OS (and any third-party window management tools). Winger simply adds a few more features that remove friction and key limitations.\n\nSo yes like tab groups, but IMHO better. Window management done well begets viable tab management.\n\nI use another window-naming (a.k.a titling) extension that I want to keep using, would it conflict with Winger?\n\nUnfortunately yes, one extension's naming may overwrite the other's.

To configure this addon go to Addons (ctrl+shift+a) ->Shortkeys ->Options. Report issues here (please specify that the issue is found in Firefox): https://github.com/mikecrittenden/shortkeys","fullDescription":"***Important:\nYou have to refresh already opened web pages after installing shortkeys to make it work on them, better yet - restart the browser after installing the extension.\nIf your shortcut does not work when an input is focused, this can be turned off in Shortcut Options -> Activation Settings -> ticking the option Active while in form fields\n\nCurrent limitations based on the Firefox API (more details on github):\n\n    shortkeys only works in the context of a loaded page. What does *NOT* work is: new tab page, addons page, or any other internal pages such as about:config,about:newtab,about:addons, etc.\n    shortkeys cannot override Firefox default shortcuts such as: ctrl+j, alt+d and\n    others using the \"Do nothing\" action *outside of the webpage* e.g. the default firefox chortcut will still work in the url bar/ search bar\n    shortkeys does not work in the url bar or the search bar, it only works in the context of a webpage\n    shortkeys will start working when the page has finished loading, not *right* after you opened a page, or clicked a link (this annoys me, too, but yeah - API Limitation:(\n\n\nShortkeys makes it easy to add custom shortcuts to your browser for the following actions:\n\n    Run custom JS\n    Do nothing (for disabling a Firefox shortcut you don't like, in the context of the page, not the whole browser window - explained above)\n    Open a bookmark or bookmarklet\n    Scroll up/down/left/right by a little or a lot\n    Scroll to the top or bottom of the page\n    Go back or forward in history\n    Jump to existing tab by URL\n    Open new tab with URL\n    Switch to the previous/next/first/last tab\n    Create a new tab or close the current tab\n    Clone the current tab\n    Close all (unpinned) tabs except for current tab\n    Reload the page\n    Copy the current URL\n    Pin/Unpin the current tab\n    Move the current tab left or right\n    Zoom in/out/reset\n    Blacklist or whitelist specific shortcuts on specific sites\n    Clear downloads (page and bar)\n    Click button and switch to next tab (for Tribal Wars players)\n\n\nShortkeys allows for enabling or disabling key combos while you're currently focused on a form field, so you can have keyboard shortcuts like \"r\" or \"shift+h\" and still be able to type those values into a form without triggering the shortcut if you want. You can also blacklist or whitelist sites per-shortcut, to pick and choose which shortcuts you don't want active on which sites (this field also supports regular expressions in the following format: /regexp/). Shortkeys lets you use pretty much any key combo you want. Key combos are zero or more modifier keys (including ⇑, shift, option, ⌥, alt, ctrl, control, command, and ⌘), and one action key (letter, number, punctuation, or special key shown below), combined with + signs. Examples: \"shift+r\", \"k\", \"ctrl+alt+f7\", \"command+pageup\", etc. You can also string multiple key combos together to make key sequences (like how Gmail has \"g i\" to go to inbox). Examples: \"g g\" or \"ctrl+t shift+f7\". Special action keys that can be used include backspace, tab, clear, enter, return, esc, escape, space, up, down, left, right, home, end, pageup, pagedown, del, delete and f1 through f19 (make sure the F keys are specified in lowecase e.g. f1).\n\nPermissions Required\nShortkeys requires the \"Your data on all websites\" permission because it's the only way to inject JavaScript code into every page, and injecting JavaScript code into every page is the only way to get Firefox to recognize custom shortcuts. If you try to register key listeners (i.e., create shortcuts) outside the context of the page, then they will be ignored by Firefox. I promise that the code that runs on the pages you visit only checks the URL against the blacklists you have set, and adds the shortcuts if they're not blacklisted. That's it. Shortkeys also requires read/write clipboard permissions so that import and export from clipboard can function.

sessions as bookmarks and access them across devices.\nAdvanced Session Manager: edit, save, change, restore.\nIt can also be your best Bookmark Manager","fullDescription":"THIS ADDON IS NOT INTENDED FOR AUTO-SAVING OF SESSIONS!\n\nSave sessions as bookmarks and access them across devices\nUsing Session Sync you can save sessions as bookmarks.\nUse the rich user interface for session management: create, restore, open, edit or delete sessions/bookmarks or add new tabs to a certain session.\n\nWhy save sessions as bookmarks?\n- all the data saved will be there no matter what addon you may use in the feature\n- when using the url bar, Firefox will automatically suggest links based on your bookmarks\n- easy access/edit/backup and then restore saved data using the integrated Bookmark Manager (even on smartphone / tablet) even if the addon is not installed\n\nShortcut keys\n- CTRL+SHIFT+F - open the Widget UI\n- CTRL+SHIFT+V - open the Tab View\n- CTRL+SHIFT+U - open the Window View\n- Shortcuts configuration can be changed from configuration (Firefox 60 and up, lower version do not offer the API required)\n\nThe sync functionality works with any bookmark synchronization service like:\n\n    Firefox Sync Account (recommended)\n    EverSync\n\nSession Sync will automatically detect new updates and display the updated sessions list across multiple machines.\n\nGeneral features\n- active session management (move around tabs)\n- advanced bookmark management\n- session restore with lazy-loading\n- session auto-saving (not backed by Bookmarks)\n- history list - session can be saved later as classic bookmark sessions\n- private windows are ignored by auto-save\n- auto-saving is only intended as a nice addition and is not full-featured (please look for other addons for complete auto-saving support)\n- session filtering (search text) and sorting by name/position/date\n- advanced drag-n-drop UI with fluid animations\n- advance UI scaling for individual UI areas (session list, bookmark list, session header and toolbar)\n- 3 working modes: Panel, Tab View, Window View\n- many other customization\n\nRequired permission explained:\n\n    Read and modify bookmarks - required for storing sessions as bookmarks as well as interacting with them\n    Input data to the clipboard - required for right-click menu in order to copy bookmark title/URL\n    Access browser tabs - required in order to be able to read/save browsing session information. (This provides only tab properties and not actual browsing content)\n    Store unlimited amount of client-side data - Required for addon Settings, favicon caching, auto-saved history as well as additional information for sessions\n    All data is stored local and/or is synced on your Firefox Account (bookmarks).","weeklyDownloads":59,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Gabriel Ivanica","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/5797747/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/199/199981.png?modified=1622132331","width":804,"height":604,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/199/199981.jpg?modified=1622132331","thumbnailWidth":532,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Session Sync -

If you cannot keep your browser open forever, or if you have multiple research projects going on at the same time, it can be convenient to just dump the current tabs on a bookmark folder, which makes it easy to resume the research activity at a later time.

customized version of SSS for my own use.\n\nWhen you select text or image on a webpage, you can quickly search from the popup or contextmenu.\n\nBy default, popup appears when you drag an image, selected text, or link, but you can choose from the following behaviors.\n\"Popup/icons behaviour\" -> \"Opening behaviour\":\n(Off / Auto / Hold Alt / Keyboard-only / Middle mouse button / Click / Drag)\n\nThere are Firefox and Microsoft Edge versions.\nMicrosoft Edge version also works with Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, but there's no technical support.\n\n## Install\n* Firefox\n* Microsoft Edge\n* Other Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome\n\n## Privacy policy\n\n    Search query are **not saved**.\n    You can use suggest(Google or DuckDuckGo or Qwant or Bing or Яндекс(Yandex) or 百度(Baidu)) in the popup search box or omnibox search, but you can disable it in the settings.\n    \"Popup/icons behaviour\" -> \"Enable search box suggest\"\n    If you set your favicon to data: scheme and disable suggest, this extension will not access the network at all.\n        exception\n            If you add a search engine from the context menu or options page, cache the favicon as data: scheme.\n            When adding a search engine from the context menu, if the normal addition is not possible, get OpenSearch if the site supports it.\n            Processes performed by the browser (update and synchronization).\n\n\n## Different\n\n    Fork Changes (Based on SSS Version 3.33.0):\n        Now works with Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.\n        The site's Content Security Policy(CSP) does not change.\n        (Original Extension(SSS) rewrites CSP to \"unsafe-inline\" after Ver.3.40.0)\n        You can search on multiple search engines at once.\n        support POST Method search engine.\n        support search engine folder management.\n        added highlighting and auto-scrolling features.\n        added the ability to highlight even if not via this add-on.\n        added Popup Style (\"Icon only\" / \"Icon and Name\" / \"Name only\").\n        (At \"Icon only\", the display mode can be temporarily switched by double-clicking)\n        support Bookmarklet. You can use Bookmarklet APIs.\n        (It can also be executed automatically when the popup is displayed) / (You can also import bookmarklets from your Bookmarks)\n        added Search box to Popup.\n        added omnibox search.\n        support suggestions from Google or DuckDuckGo or Qwant or Bing or Яндекс(Yandex) or 百度(Baidu) in the popup search box or omnibox search.\n        added Hotkey search.\n        added a function to easily add a search engine from the text box context menu.\n        added search URL {linkurl}. {linkurl} is supports \"Advanced usage\".\n        (Used when you want to search by link URI. You can do the same by holding down the Ctrl key when searching from the context menu)\n        If no text is selected, the Clipboard Text is searched.\n        Context menu display options.\n        You can also search by link text or image URL.\n        added Popup Opening behaviour \"click\" / \"drag\"\n        added \"Popup/icons behaviour\" -> \"Right mouse button click\" / \"Right mouse button Long-click\" / \"Left mouse button Long-click\"\n        added \"Context menu\" -> \"Middle mouse button click\" / \"Right mouse button click\"\n        added Open in Window (\"reuse new

displayed in dark mode.\n    Import/Export Compatibility with the Original Extension Ver.3.33.0:\n        Import can also import file from the Original Extension.\n        File exported by SPC is not compatible with the Original Extension Search engines setting.\n    Permissions different from Original Extension Ver.3.33.0:\n        removed permissions: downloads, webNavigation.\n        added

- Too many tabs? Convert tabs to a list and reduce browser memory","fullDescription":"Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\n\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nInformation about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nDepending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?\nA: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the \"bookmark all tabs\" browser feature?\nA: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.","weeklyDownloads":3289,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"OneTab Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10945418/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/269/269564.png?modified=1652891576","width":2400,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/269/269564.jpg?modified=1652891576","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.2021,"reviewCount":952,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/reviews/","updateDate":1652169617000},{"id":"url2clipboard@asamuzak.jp","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/794/794631-32.png?modified=86990aed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/794/794631-64.png?modified=86990aed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/794/794631-128.png?modified=86990aed"},"name":"Copy URL To Clipboard","version":"7.1.7","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3943932/url2clipboard-7.1.7.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/asamuzaK/url2clipboard","supportURL":"https://github.com/asamuzaK/url2clipboard/issues","description":"Copy document URL / link URL to clipboard as HTML, Markdown, BBCode, Textile, AsciiDoc, MediaWiki, Jira, reStructuredText, LaTeX, Text.","fullDescription":"Copy document URL / link URL to clipboard as HTML, Markdown, BBCode, Textile, AsciiDoc, MediaWiki, Jira, reStructuredText, LaTeX, Text.\n\n* When copying the URL of the page, right-click anywhere on the page and open the context menu, then select the format to copy.\n* When you right-click on a link (an anchor element), you can copy the URL of that link.\n* If you select some text before right-click, that selected text will be used for the content of the link.\n* You can edit content text when copying.\n* Copy to clipboard can be executed from the context menu, the tool button, or keyboard shortcut.\n\nNOTE: Currently, enabled only on (X)HTML documents.","weeklyDownloads":80,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"asamuzaK","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/4777581/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/185/185129.png?modified=1622374308","width":700,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185129.jpg?modified=1622374308","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"contextmenu"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/185/185130.png?modified=1622374308","width":700,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185130.jpg?modified=1622374308","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"toolbar button"}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/asamuzakjp?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.32,"reviewCount":17,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/url2clipboard/reviews/","updateDate":1655153192000},{"id":"{60f82f00-9ad5-4de5-b31c-b16a47c51558}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/905/905349-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/905/905349-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/905/905349-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Cookie Quick Manager","version":"0.5rc2","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3343599/cookie_quick_manager-0.5rc2.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/ysard/cookie-quick-manager","supportURL":"https://github.com/ysard/cookie-quick-manager/issues","description":"An addon to manage cookies (view, search, create, edit, remove, backup, restore, protect from deletion and much more). Firefox 57+ is supported.","fullDescription":"Overview\n\nCookie Quick Manager: A complete manager for cookies accumulated during browsing.\nIt allows you to view, edit, create, delete, backup, restore cookies and search them by domain names. Contextual Identities such as Private Browsing, First-Party Isolation, and SameSite flag are also supported.\nIn addition, the LocalStorage of the page viewed can be deleted (see below).\n\nCookie Quick Manager is designed for developers, testers or people\nconcerned about their privacy on the Internet.\n\nThis WebExtension is compatible with Firefox 57 and is inspired by addons like Cookies Manager+ and Advanced Cookie Manager whose development has been discontinued due to the withdrawal of the support for \"Legacy\" extensions.\n\nNovember 2018: Cookie Quick Manager is now available on Android!\n\nFeatures\n\n    User friendly: Clear and structured user interface. Each parameter and functionality is described when the mouse is over the element.\n    Windowed and tab mode: Choose the opening in a tab to get a wider view.\n    Transparency and security: The source code is free (under GPLv3) and published on a public platform, the only way to allow reviews and external contributions.\n    Search: A user can search for cookies of a domain and subdomains which depend on it.\n    Edit/Create: All the attributes of a cookie can be modified: domain, path, name, value, expiration date, as well as secure and httponly flags.\n    Delete: Remove the cookies of the current website in two clicks.\n    Export: The export and import of one or many cookies from one or many domains at a time in JSON or Netscape format is just as easy.\n    First-Party Isolation: Supported with some limitations (due to API bugs) on Firefox 59, 60, and 61, and without limitations on Firefox 62 (scheduled on September 2018).\n    Contexts: Contexts (also called Multi-Account Containers, or Contextual Identities) are supported. A user can search and display cookies inside a container, or copy cookies from a container to another, or save a cookie in a specific context.\n    SameSite: The SameSite flag is supported. This is a partial protection against the risks associated with Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) attacks, implemented since Firefox 63.\n    Cookie protection: Delete cookies except protected ones, with two clicks at anytime from the website you are viewing. An option can also prevent cookies from being deleted by the sites themselves.\n    Protection of session cookies: Session cookies can be protected in two clicks to prevent accidental logout from websites after cleaning normal cookies.\n    Cleaning and privacy: Can automatically delete all cookies at startup.\n    LocalStorage: Keys/values of the page viewed can be deleted.\n\n\n\nPrivacy\n\nThis addon does not store or leak any personal information.\n\nIt requires the following permissions to operate:\n\n    Host permission for all urls: This allows you to edit the cookies and to delete the Localstorage of any site visited.\n    Cookies: Allows access to the browser's cookie store.\n    ActiveTab: Allows access to the currently consulted url, and its favicon if it exists.\n    Storage: Allows the storage of the following user settings:\n    - size of the windowed mode,\n    - protected cookies (only the name of the domains),\n    - the template used to import/export the cookies,\n    - the skin.\n    Browsing data: Enables extensions to clear the data that is accumulated while the user is browsing (LocalStorage here).\n    Contextual Identities: Allows the addon to list the containers.\n    Privacy: Access and modify various privacy-related browser settings (the FirstPartyIsolation flag here).\n    ClipboardWrite (optional): Allows the export of cookies to the clipboard from Firefox 63.\n\n\n\nAbout cookie protection\n\nThe protection of cookies is limited to the current addon actions, to the deletions that can be made by the sites themselves, or to the deletions made in the browser's \"Cookies and Site Data\" options.\nThis means that if you choose the browser option to delete all cookies when it closes, the addon will be unable to restore them (the method used by the browser does not send the necessary signal to notify the addon). However, a similar option is reimplemented in the addon itself in order to keep only the protected cookies when restarting the browser.\n\n\nWhat is \"Delete Current Site Local Storage\" on the popup menu?\n\nThis item allows a user to delete LocalStorage keys from the viewed page.\n\nThe LocalStorage is a quite new feature of HTML5 that allows developers to create data in your browser using JavaScript. Cookies are just one type of storage among others.\nYou will also find the term \"SessionStorage\", a LocalStorage where data is stored temporarily (deleted on browser restart), but the important thing is that LocalStorage is persistent, and cleared only at the discretion of the visited websites.\nYou may erase all of the LocalStorage store by following the procedure described in the documentation of Firefox, and by selecting \"Offline Website Data\".\n\nFrom the point of view of privacy and security:\n\nThis kind of persistant data (even after clearing cache), was invented to store small data allowing the operation of online applications, but also offers new and better accurate ways of tracking thanks to the memorization of private or identifying data.\n\n\nSupport & source code\n\nThe extension is still in development with the launch of Firefox Quantum; questions, bug reports and feature requests are open on the GitHub repository.\n\n\nLicense\n\nGPLv3.","weeklyDownloads":4872,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Ysard","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13597965/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/211/211222.png?modified=1622132873","width":293,"height":170,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/211/211222.jpg?modified=1622132873","thumbnailWidth":293,"thumbnailHeight":170,"caption":"Contextual menu on Firefox.

Since you can specify the format to be copied, you can copy it in any format such as Markdown format or html anchor format.\n\nThe operation when looking up a dictionary is following the Dictionary Tooltip add-on which was very easy to use.\n\nThis add-on queries the web site that accepts the GET / POST method using the selected character string, the character string of the clipboard, the URL of an open web page, etc., and sends the returned result to the tooltip, panel, side Bar, other TAB, other windows, etc., or launching the subprocess of the local PC and passing the character string as an argument. With the ability to launch a sub-process, You can do something like AppLauncher and Open With. Since you can register any site you can also use it as bookmarks or Context Search X as well. You can specify multiple elements such as page URL and selected character string at the same time, so you can use Google site search like Site Searcher, Search Site WE or Search the current site.\n\nThe web site to ask inquiries is not limited to dictionaries and translation sites, but anywhere you can use GET / POST methods such as google search, youtube etc.\n\nSettings for the dictionary / search services, such as which character string to use, where to send it and where to display the results must be written in a text file in JSON format. The syntax used in this file is simple. Please use Unicode UTF-8 for the character code of the file. Shift_JIS garbled characters.

Details below.\n\nSee my video about Link Tools.\n\nA WebExtension that allows you to manipulate links in various ways. Has the following features:\n\n    Get parts of links and altered links, e.g. convert between desktop and mobile links, extract identifiers, or change to alternate domains.\n    Operations to copy things to the clipboard and to visit links.\n    Can operate on links in the page (right-click) and the page address.\n    Can decode embedded links (provided a pattern is known), exposing them to all copy and visit operations.\n    Limited ability to decode query parameters.\n    Optional popup thumbnails on mouseover (requires URLs that can be derived directly from given links).\n    A facility is provided for adding your own operations, as well as importing and exporting them.\n\n\nSource code is on GitHub. Bug reports and feature requests may be submitted there.\n\nI'm looking for people's input about what types of addresses they'd like to see useful operations on in this extension. Right now, the set of built-ins is quite limited, because that's all I could think of. Although you are able to configure your own, there are probably many that should be included with the extension. If you have ideas, I encourage you to get in touch. You can email me using the support email or website shown on this extension's listing page. If you prefer to chat, you can also try the Discord I set up. Whichever method you choose, try to provide the following in your suggestion:\n\n    A link to the site, if possible. However, if an account is required to access the part of the site where the relevant type of link can be found, unless I already happen to have an account, this will not be helpful.\n    One or more examples of such addresses. Remember that Link Tools can only extract information from the address itself; it does not try to look up anything.\n    If there are thumbnails associated with such an address, it will help if you can describe or provide examples of those as well. For these, too, it must be possible to generate the address based only on the link. For example, YouTube videos have thumbnails, the addresses of which are generated based solely on the video ID, which is present in the video address; therefore, the thumbnail can be shown when mousing over a YouTube video link.\n\n\nAnother thing that I'm looking for is types of addresses with embedded links. Right now, I only have a handful. I might come up with more myself, but I can't think of everything, so please don't hesitate to submit examples.

Simply right click to open Firefox’s context menu when multiple windows are open, pick the window you want to merge with, and done!\n\nIt focusses on merging windows alone, but gives some usability choices that other alternatives do not have like user defined keyboard shortcuts and accessibility through the browser’s own Tools menu.\n\nHave a look at the screenshots to see what is on offer!\n\n    Window Merger does not require you to merge everything. Often people wanted to merge only specific windows together, so that choice had to be given.\n    Window Merger does not require you to use a mouse. It offers configurable keyboard actions for those who prefer it.\n    Window Merger works together with Private Windows. Private windows are kept separate from normal windows in all features. A private window will only ever merge with another private window, making sure tabs do not leak into non-private space.\n\nHave a look at the screenshots to see what is on offer!\n\nSpecial care was taken to make sure the extension would fit well within the browser. Its preferences screen integrates with the Extensions page really well, and adheres to dark mode if chosen by the user. Releases are also tested with ESR versions of Firefox to be as accessible as possible.\n\nBeside this Window Merger tries to stick to the Linux mantra of “Do One Thing and Do It Well”.\n\nSome other tab management extensions you may like:\n\n    FoxyTab — for the all in one thing. If Window Merger does not satisfy your habits, chances are a configuration of FoxyTab exists that does!\n    Duplicate Tabs Closer — for cleaning tabs after merging windows. If getting rid only of windows is not enough, Duplicate Tabs Closer can help you to clear out tabs as well!","weeklyDownloads":10,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Martijn","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12497029/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/249/249459.png?modified=1622134768","width":691,"height":416,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/249/249459.jpg?modified=1622134768","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":321},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/249/249460.png?modified=1622134768","width":724,"height":258,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/249/249460.jpg?modified=1622134768","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":190},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/249/249456.png?modified=1622134769","width":641,"height":197,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/249/249456.jpg?modified=1622134769","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":164},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/249/249457.png?modified=1622134771","width":724,"height":507,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/249/249457.jpg?modified=1622134771","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":373},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/249/249458.png?modified=1622134772","width":724,"height":507,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/249/249458.jpg?modified=1622134772","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":373}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.4286,"reviewCount":4,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/window-merger/reviews/","updateDate":1608904519000},{"id":"{4414b331-7fa6-4c35-803a-b6b4db451224}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2694/2694862-32.png?modified=2551870f","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2694/2694862-64.png?modified=2551870f","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2694/2694862-128.png?modified=2551870f"},"name":"Pocket

All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents ETag tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy.

A tab is removed from the line once it has finished loading. The first blocked tab in the line is then allowed to load. This extension was designed for users with slow internet connections that routinely open multiple background tabs at the same time. It also helps users that open many background tabs at once by not overwhelming their browser or CPU.\n\nOnly tabs with http or https URLs can be blocked from loading by this extension. In many cases, the URL to be loaded in a new tab can't be viewed by this extension when the tab is created and added to the line. Tabs with URLs that can't be blocked and that were added to the line will quickly be removed when the URL is viewable. An exception is a moz-extension URL that belongs to this extension. Some URLs may not be viewable by an extension, like URLs that launch applications. Tabs with these URLs may get stuck in the line. They will be ignored and the extension will work around them.\n\nVarious commands or settings for the extension can be accessed in the toolbar button popup or in its Options page.\n\nChrome version (beta): https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/load-background-tabs-lazi/jomliinifiaagjbbjncdncgoolfiakjj\n\nRead Before Installing\n\nIf 'When you open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately' is unselected in Firefox's Option page, a mouse middle click on a web page link will create a new tab in the background. Otherwise, a shift middle click can be used to create a background tab. A bookmark opened in a new tab is not loaded in the background by default. A preference to reverse that behavior is in the about:config page:\n\n    browser.tabs.loadBookmarksInBackground (Control behavior of new tabs opened from bookmarks and history.)\n        true: Load the tab in the background.\n        false (default): Load the tab in the foreground.\n\nIf that setting is changed to true, a mouse middle click will open a bookmark in a new tab in the background. Otherwise, a shift middle click must be used.\n\n\nConflicting Extensions\n\nHoldTab, LoadTabOnSelect, LoadTabOnSelect Evolution, and LoadTabOnSelect 3. These are extensions that block a new background tab from loading until it is selected.\n\nTemporary Containers. The conflict happens when a blocked background tabs hostname is a match under Temporary Containers 'Per Domain Isolation'.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\nBlocked tabs that are removed from the line before they have loaded can't be added back to the line if the extension is turned off or Firefox is restarted. Please select the 'Make new background tabs session proof' option, if this is a concern.\n\nThe title of a blocked tab that is recovered after a previous session is restored is 'New Tab' in Firefox 67+ (the title used to be blank). The option 'Make new background tabs session proof' will preserve the tab titles.\n\nTabs with restricted sites like addons.mozilla.org and support.mozilla.org can't be blocked from loading by this extension.\n\nWhen creating multiple tabs at once, some extensions will create them all as active tabs. Focus will end up on the last tab created, usually the rightmost tab. Enabling the option 'Add new tabs to the line that are created as active tabs.' is necessary to add these tabs to the line and then block them.\n\nIf browser.sessionstore.restore_pinned_tabs_on_demand is set to true in the about:config page, Firefox will not show pinned tabs as discarded tabs to an extension after a Firefox restart. This means commands like 'Add discarded tabs' will not work correctly in this situation, until the bug is fixed.\n\nIt is not recommended to open more than 1000 non discarded background tabs all at once. Firefox starts to become unusable on an average computer, when pushing it too much further than that.\n\nWhen a bookmark folder is middle clicked, the first bookmark in the folder is loaded into an active tab. By default, this tab is not added to the line. A shift middle click on a bookmark folder will open all the bookmarks in the background.\n\n(Bug fixed in Firefox 88) There is a Firefox bug where an extension may be given the wrong URL for a tab after the tab is discarded by an extension. To reproduce the bug, select a discarded tab that was created by a 'Restore previous session', created as a new discarded tab by an extension, or that was already discarded by an extension (like Auto Tab Discard). Let the tab finish loading, load a different URL in the tab, and then discard the tab with an extension. Extensions will now be given the previous URL for the tab, which can be verified by bookmarking it (without activating it first). Note that this issue only effects this extension in rare situations and is cleared up after a 'Restore previous session'.\n\n\nRelevant about:config Preferences\n\n    browser.sessionstore.restore_pinned_tabs_on_demand (Control how pinned tabs are loaded when a session is restored.)\n        true: Pinned tabs are not loaded until they are selected.\n        false (default): Firefox loads pinned tabs 3 at a time.\n    browser.sessionstore.restore_on_demand (Control how non-pinned tabs are loaded when a session is restored.)\n        true (default): Tabs are not loaded until they are selected (they are discarded).\n        false: Firefox loads non-pinned tabs 3 at a time, after pinned tabs have loaded.\n    browser.tabs.loadDivertedInBackground (Control behavior of pages normally meant to open in a new window, but that have instead been loaded in a new tab.)\n        true: Load the new tab in the background, leaving focus on the current tab.\n        false (default): Load the new tab in the foreground, taking the focus from the current tab.\n    browser.link.open_newwindow (Control behavior of links that would normally open in a new window.)\n        1: Open in the current tab/window.\n        2: Open in a new window.\n        3 (default): Open in a new tab in the current window.\n    browser.link.open_newwindow.override.external (This preference overrides browser.link.open_newwindow for external links. Set it only if a different destination for external links is needed.)\n        -1 (default): No overrides.\n        1: Open in the current tab/window.\n        2: Open in a new window.\n        3: Open in a new tab in the current window.\n\n\nPermissions\n\n    Access your data for all websites\n        Allows the viewing of top-level http or https net requests that are about to be made for a tab. This extension can then decide to allow, block, or redirect the requests.\n    Read and modify bookmarks\n        Allows the viewing of bookmark URLs when creating new discarded tabs.\n    Read and modify browser settings\n        Allows the viewing and modifying of newTabPosition and openBookmarksInNewTabs global browser settings.\n    Access browsing history\n        Allows the removal of moz-extension URLs that belong to this extension from a user's browsing history.\n    Access browser tabs\n        Allows access to the title and URL of all tabs.\n    Access browser activity during navigation\n        Allows the extension to view various stages of a web navigation such as when a tab commits to loading a URL or completes loading.\n    Access recently closed tabs\n        Allows the extension to save data to a window and recover that data if the window is closed and restored.

Supported media formats are MP3, MP4, WEBM. Capture frames from online videos with a screenshot button.","fullDescription":"UDL Helper is a powerful YouTube downloader. In most cases, you can download a MP3 or MP4 file with one click, otherwise, please, follow the link to uniDownloader website and use UDL Client software (Windows only). The extension also supports downloading videos from other social media services: Instagram (Insta) and Odnoklassniki (OK).\n\nYou are able to extract music from such videos, thus UDL Helper is a powerful online video to MP3 converter: YouTube to MP3 converter, Instagram to MP3 converter, Odnoklassniki to MP3 converter.\n\nThe extension can be used to take screenshots from online videos: it adds a screenshot button to YouTube and Odnoklassniki players.\n\nMost extension features are universal for any video service, but some features are service-specific. See details on UDL Helper’s page. YouTube features are listed below.\n\nDownload YouTube video:\n\n    in MP4 format with sound (*);\n    with normal and high frame rates (e.g. 60 fps);\n    in resolutions: 360p, 720p [HD], 1080p [Full HD], 1440p 2K [Ultra HD], 2160p 4K [Ultra HD], 4320p 8K [Ultra HD].\n\nDownload YouTube audio (from video):\n\n    in MP4 and MP3 (**) formats;\n    at the highest possible bitrate.\n\nImportant: the list of available download options depends on characteristics of the original video! E.g. initially posted 360p @30 fps video without sound cannot be downloaded in Full HD @60 fps with sound.\n\nOther features of the browser extension:\n\n    Downloaded files have readable (human-friendly) names;\n    You can automatically get (copy to the clipboard) a direct link to the video (where such link exists);\n    Download videos to your phone or tablet by sending the link to your mobile device using a QR code (where such link exists);\n    The extension has stylish design with support of YouTube light and dark themes;\n    You can choose the button style: modern interface (appears on mouse over) and classic interface (appears on click);\n    \"Embedded\" videos loading support, i.e. YouTube videos hosted on third-party sites;\n    YouTube screenshot button, i.e. save frames while watching videos;\n    Thoughtful help section with answers to frequently asked questions;\n    Several really useful settings :)\n\n(*) In some cases, YouTube stores audio and video streams separately, therefore, to download video with sound they must be “glued” (muxing):\n\n    for small streams (up to 2 GB in total) the extension itself merges audio and video files, i.e. “on-the-fly” right in the browser;\n    for larger streams it is proposed to use UDL Client utility to avoid “freezing” of the browser tab.\n\n(**) YouTube doesn't support MP3 format. So, to grab MP3 sound from YouTube videos, the extension uses built-in audio converter for files up to 2 GB or suggests using UDL Client software otherwize.","weeklyDownloads":496,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"unidownloader.com","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/16993433/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/264/264594.png?modified=1640467204","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/264/264594.jpg?modified=1640467204","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/264/264595.png?modified=1640467204","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/264/264595.jpg?modified=1640467204","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/264/264596.png?modified=1640467204","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/264/264596.jpg?modified=1640467204","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/264/264597.png?modified=1640467204","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/264/264597.jpg?modified=1640467204","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/264/264598.png?modified=1640467204","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/264/264598.jpg?modified=1640467204","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/264/264599.png?modified=1640467204","width":1280,"height":792,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/264/264599.jpg?modified=1640467204","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":330}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.4074,"reviewCount":22,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-downloader-udl-helper/reviews/","updateDate":1655677870000},{"id":"hide_private_mode@matt.tf","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2590/2590216-32.png?modified=3cc8c10b","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2590/2590216-64.png?modified=3cc8c10b","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2590/2590216-128.png?modified=3cc8c10b"},"name":"Hide Private Mode","version":"0.0.6","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3543706/hide_private_mode-0.0.6.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":"https://github.com/hensm/hide_private_mode","description":"Prevents detection of private browsing mode.","fullDescription":"News sites like The New York Times, LATimes, New Statesman, etc. try to detect private browsing mode via the presence of the IndexedDB API and block access to the site.

A Firefox Recommended Extension!\n\nAbout TinEye\n\nTinEye is a reverse image search engine that allows you to search by image. TinEye uses image identification technology, not keywords: when you upload an image to TinEye, TinEye creates a unique and compact digital signature or 'fingerprint' for it, then compares this fingerprint to every other image in the TinEye index to find matches. TinEye does not typically find similar images; it finds exact matches including those that have been cropped, edited or resized. If you have never used TinEye, check out our tutorial.\n\nTinEye is perfect for:\n\n    Image verification: find out if a news photo is really what it claims to be, or if that dating profile is a scammer using someone else’s headshot\n    Image attribution: track the original source and ownership of an image\n    Image licensing: see if an image is available from stock image websites to be licensed\n\n\nUsing TinEye is private. We don’t track your searches, keep your images or add them to the TinEye index. The only data we collect is the version of the extension that you’re using. For more information, please see our privacy policy.\n\nTinEye Terms and Conditions\n\nHow to use this extension\n\nTo use the extension, right-click on any web image and select Search image on TinEye from the context menu. Results are displayed for you at tineye.com.\n\nTo set extension preferences go to Tools > Add-ons in the Firefox menu bar. Locate TinEye Reverse Image search in the Add-ons window list. Click the three dots on the right side of the entry and choose Preferences.
